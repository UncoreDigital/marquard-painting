      <p class="project-details__room-wallpapers-text">
        Marquard Painting Inc. was officially licensed in California in 1994. I
        proudly put my name on the company because I stand behind the quality of
        every job we do. My passion for painting began early—when I was twelve,
        helping my dad paint our family home in Almaden. That first brushstroke
        stuck with me, and by the early 1970s, my interest in the trade had
        taken root. After moving to North Lake Tahoe in search of adventure, I
        fell in love with the High Sierra lifestyle—skiing, hiking, sailing,
        fishing, backpacking, and cycling. I supported myself with seasonal jobs
        in restaurants, ski lodges, and even chain control during the winters.
        One sunny June day, I spotted a crew of painters working across the
        street from the lake. They looked like they were having a great time. I
        walked over and asked the foreman, Larry Larson, “Are you hiring?” He
        asked if I had any experience. “Yeah,” I replied. “Great—show up
        tomorrow at 8 a.m. in your whites,” he said. I didn’t even know what
        “whites” were—but I drove straight to Sears in Reno, bought a pair of
        white painter’s overalls, and showed up the next morning. That day
        marked the start of my professional painting journey, and I’ve never
        looked back.

          The projects included a wide variety of finishes. With a lot of
          finishing of cabinetry and millwork. Using stains,glazes,dyes, lacquer
          polyurethane ,and enamel. Do it right the first time are or you own
          the cabinets. It's hard work,stressful and unhealthy. We were very
          good at it. The crew also has traveled to paint customer's vacation
          homes, most recently Hawaii for 20 days. Currently Marquard is seeking
          corporate and maintenance facility painting accounts. Our accounts
          include Jones Lang LaSalle, Intuit Mountain View since 07, McManis
          Falkner law firm since 94, WeWork,Cloudera, Almaden Country School,
          Alt School San Francisco. After 45 years of painting I still enjoy
          every day,new projects,accounts and challenges. I promise you a great
          painting experience. Give me a shout and we'll talk about your
          painting needs. Done once, done right, on time or your money back.
