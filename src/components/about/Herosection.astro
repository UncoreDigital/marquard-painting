      <p class="project-details__room-wallpapers-text">
        Marquard Painting Inc. was officially licensed in California in 1994. I
        proudly put my name on the company because I stand behind the quality of
        every job we do. My passion for painting began early—when I was twelve,
        helping my dad paint our family home in Almaden. That first brushstroke
        stuck with me, and by the early 1970s, my interest in the trade had
        taken root. After moving to North Lake Tahoe in search of adventure, I
        fell in love with the High Sierra lifestyle—skiing, hiking, sailing,
        fishing, backpacking, and cycling. I supported myself with seasonal jobs
        in restaurants, ski lodges, and even chain control during the winters.
        One sunny June day, I spotted a crew of painters working across the
        street from the lake. They looked like they were having a great time. I
        walked over and asked the foreman, Larry Larson, “Are you hiring?” He
        asked if I had any experience. “Yeah,” I replied. “Great—show up
        tomorrow at 8 a.m. in your whites,” he said. I didn’t even know what
        “whites” were—but I drove straight to Sears in Reno, bought a pair of
        white painter’s overalls, and showed up the next morning. That day
        marked the start of my professional painting journey, and I’ve never
        looked back.

      <p class="project-details__result-text">
      Our projects have included a wide variety of finishes, with extensive experience in cabinetry and millwork. We work with stains, glazes, dyes, lacquer, polyurethane, and enamel. The work is demanding, stressful, and not always easy—but we became very good at it.
Our crew has also traveled to paint customers’ vacation homes, most recently completing a 20-day project in Hawaii.
Marquard Painting is currently seeking corporate and maintenance facility painting accounts. Our long-standing clients include Jones Lang LaSalle, Intuit Mountain View (since 2007), McManis Faulkner Law Firm (since 1994), WeWork, Cloudera, Almaden Country School, and AltSchool San Francisco.
After 45 years in the trade, I still enjoy each day, every project, every client, and every new challenge. I promise you a great painting experience. Give me a call, and we’ll discuss your painting needs. Done once, done right, on time—or your money back.
